# Weighted-Adaptive-Partition
The code is realized by CUAVE dataset, which consists of two different modalities. The features of audio data and video data are extracted by Gaussian RBM and GB-Matrix Variable RBM seperetly, then the equal-weighted multi-modality RBM and weighted multi-modality are used to do the feature fusion.
The red dotted lines are the change boundary of the data stream and the green dotted line is the threshold, which is calculated according to the Hoeffding inequality.
